The purpose of this project is to create backend for an ecommerce website to organizing and manipulating via CRUD data having to do with products, their categories, and product tags.

Navigate to the root folder of the application where the server.js file sits.

To create the data base, you can source the schema.sql file by changing the sequelize sync force value to 'true' in the server.js file, and running the server by 'npm start' in the command line of the root folder (as seen in the screen shot below).
